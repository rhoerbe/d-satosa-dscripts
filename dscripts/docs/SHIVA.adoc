= SHIVA (Simple Hack for Image Verification and Authentication)

SHIVA verifies the authenticity and integrity of Docker images using sigital signatures.
The goal of image verification is to make sure that the image downloaded from the registry is the
same as that created by the developer. While Docker offers Docker Content Trust, this LiveCD chose
to use a simple and explicit GPG-signature scheme instead, which is easier to understand and to audit.

== How does it work

The basis for Docker image signatures is the content digest, which will appear on `docker push`and
`docker images --digests`. It can be obtained on the command line with

    docker inspect --format='{{.RepoDigests}}' <image id|name>

Digests (DIDI files) are created and signed using PGP signatures for each image verison. Each file name
starts with the first 16 characters of the digest of an image version and is published at an URL
specified in the 'LABEL didi_dir' statement in the Dockerfile. These files are used by the
consumer to vouch for the integrity and authenticity of images pulled from repositories based on
the pre-shared public key of the signer.

=== Docker Image Digest Indicator ('DIDI')

The content digest and the image name are extracted into a json-formatted file for cryptographic verification,
e.g.:

{
    "FormatVersion": 1,
    "RepoTags": [
        "rhoerbe/keymgmt-safenetac:latest"
    ],
    "RepoDigests": [
        "rhoerbe/keymgmt-safenetac@sha256:2b381f1e1848eb889516a7b432cefec001904f9a603ac9bb3b3a6c2352efd6e0"
    ],
}

The filename for the signature claim is produced by concatenating the first 16 characters of the digest with '.json'.


== Usage

Prerequisites: The signer can create signatures

    gpg2 -K

=== Signature Creation

The developer creates a PGP-signed DIDI file using the descripts/sign.sh script. Each image version has
a separate file, allowing to verify multiple versions in parallel. To activate image signing for
an image the conf.sh script must define the signer's PGP uid in the DIDI_SIGNER variable and
the default key in GPG_SIGN_OPTIONS, e.g.

    export DIDI_SIGNER='tester@testinetics.at'
    export GPG_SIGN_OPTIONS='--default-key <key-id>'

The DIDI file must be made available at an URL that the signature verifier can access, e.g. in Github. The URL must
be put into a label in the Dockerfile, where the URL points to the directory that will hold one or more DIDI files for
the image.

=== Key Sharing

The public key must be installed and trusted on the target system (via RPM or some other mechanism).
The signer needs to make her public key and trustdb-entry available either via a key server or as follows:

    gpg2 -k
        /root/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
        ------------------------
        pub   2048R/B5341047 2017-03-18 [verfällt: 2019-03-18]
        uid                  Test User <tester@testinetics.at>
        sub   2048R/65622119 2017-03-18 [verfällt: 2019-03-18]

    gpg2 --armor --export tester@testinetics.at > testerTestineticsAt_pub.gpg
    gpg2 --export-ownertrust > testerTestineticsAt_trust.gpg

Import the key on the target system:

    gpg2 --import testerTestineticsAt_pub.gpg
    echo -e "trust\n5\ny" > trust.cmd
    gpg2 --command-file trust.cmd –edit-key B5341047   # replace the key id with the actual one
    # As result you should see unlimited trust in the userid:
    gpg --list-keys --list-options show-uid-validity

As alternative import the key from a key server:

    gpg2 -k
    gpg2 --card-status
    gpg2 --card-edit
        fetch
        quite


=== Signature Verification

Target system verifies the signature if DIDI_SIGNER is set by performing following steps:

- get DIDI directory URL from the image
- create a local DIDI file
- compare the remote and local DID file
- validate the local DIDI file with the detached signature at the remote DIDI directory

    dscripts/validate.sh # explicit
    dscripts/run  # implicit

The message "WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!" can be removed by
signing the key; however, the critical trust decision is to trust the pre-shared key.

=== Test normalization and PGP detached signatures

Trailing whitespace does change the signature value. Observe to transfer didi files in binary.
